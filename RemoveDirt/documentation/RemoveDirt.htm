		<P>Version 0.8 of this plugin has been completely rewritten from scratch. It no 
			more contains a RemoveDirt filter. It now only contains the filter 
			RestoreMotionBlocks, which is the&nbsp;core element of the AVS script function 
			RemoveDirt discussed below. The old RemoveDirt suffered from two problems. 
			Firstly, fast motion of big objects was getting jerky after RemoveDirt 
			filtering and secondly the essentially temporal approach of RemoveDirt was no 
			more competitive with the spatial-temporal approach of RemoveDust (an AVS 
			script function derived from&nbsp;my <A href="http://www.RemoveGrain.de.tf">RemoveGrain</A>&nbsp;package) 
			as far as compression performance is concerned. If my theory about jerky 
			RemoveDirt motion is correct, the new RemoveDirt script function will resolve 
			this problem. The basic idea of the new script function is to use the old 
			RemoveDirt for static aseas and a sharper version of RemoveDust for the motion 
			areas, where RemoveDirt didn't do any cleaning before. Altogether the new 
			RemoveDirt aims to achieve similar or better compression than RemoveDust with 
			considerable more details in motion areas, where RemoveDust often destroyed 
			fine details.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the massive changes the old <A href="http://home.pages.at/kassandro/RemoveDirt/RemoveDirt.zip">
				binary</A> and the old <A href="http://home.pages.at/kassandro/RemoveDirt/RemoveDirt-src.zip">
				source code</A> will remain available for the time being.&nbsp;&nbsp;If 
			you&nbsp;have questions or suggestions about RemoveDirt or ResoterMotionBlocks, 
			don't&nbsp;hesitate to post&nbsp;in the <A href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=70856">
				RemoveDirt thread</A>&nbsp;of the doom9 forum rather than sending me email.
		</P>
		<P>RemoveDirt v0.9.1 supports the color spaces Y8, YV12, YV16, YV24 and planar YUY2.
            If possible, don't use YUY2, use YV16 instead.
            If you still want to use it with YUY2 clips, you have to convert from interleaved 
            YUY2 to planar YUY2 before RestoreMotionBlocks and then back to interleaved YUY2 
            with the filters Interleaved2Planar and Planar2Interleaved from SSETools plugin.

		<center>RestoreMotionBlocks(filtered, restore, neighbour, neighbour2, alternative, 
			gmthreshold, mthreshold, pthreshold, cthreshold, noise, noisy, dist, tolerance, 
			dmode, grey, show, debug)</center>
		<p>The first&nbsp;five variables are clip variables. All clips must be of the same 
			type (same width, height and color space). The number of frames is the minimum 
			of the length of all these five clips. The first two variables are mandatory. 
			"filtered" is usually an aggressively filtered clip, from which motion 
			artifacts have to removed. If RestoreMotionBlocks identfies an 8x8 block as a 
			motion block, it copies this block from the clip "restore" to the clip 
			"filtered". This is the basic operation of RestoreMotionBlocks. To identify 
			motion blocks RestoreMotionBlocks uses the clip "neighbour". The default value 
			for neighbour is the "restore" clip. However, in the RemoveDirt script 
			"neighbour" is different from "restore". The "neighbour2" is for using 
			RemoveDirt in combination with motion compensation filters like MVtools (see 
			MCRemoveDirt below). Finally, if the number of motion blocks exceeds the 
			percentage specified in the "gmthreshold" variable, then RestoreMotionBlocks 
			simply takes the frame from the clip "alternative". In this way, scene switches 
			or global motion can be handled specifically. The clip "restore" is the default 
			value&nbsp; for "alternative". The default value for gmthreshold is 80, i.e. if 
			80% of the blocks are motion blocks, then the frame is taken from 
			"alternative". "mthreshold" is similar&nbsp;as in the old RemoveDirt. However, 
			because we now use the ordinary SAD for block comparison, the values should be 
			somewhat higher, especially if the value of noise is low. The default value for 
			"mthreshold" is 160. With the variable "noise" one can specify a noise level, 
			which should be ignored by the motion detection. The default value of "noise" 
			is 0. The variable "noisy" is used to specifiy the number of noisy 
			pixels&nbsp;of an 8x8 block, which must be exceeded for a motion block. If 
			noisy &gt;= 0 and noise &gt; 0, then the value of "mthreshold" is ignored. The 
			variables "pthreshold" and "cthreshold" are the same as in the old RemoveDirt. 
			Postprocessing is has not been changed in the new RemoveDirt. The default value 
			for pthreshold is 10 and cthreshold inherits the value of pthreshold by 
			default. Negative values are allowed for pthreshold and cthreshold, but are not 
			very reasonable. The variables "dist" and "tolerance" are the same as in the 
			old RemoveDirt plugin if dmode=0, the default. The default value for dist 
			is&nbsp;1 and the default value for tolerance is 12. If grey=true (false is the 
			default value), then the chroma is ignored by RestoreMotionBlocks. The boolean 
			variables "show" and "debug" are used for debugging (see section Debugging).
		</p>
		<H2><FONT size="6">How RestoreMotionBlocks works</FONT></H2>
		<P>To use the above variables properly, one has to understand how 
			RestoreMotionBlocks works. It consists of three phases. For the first phase 
			only the clip "neighbour" is used.&nbsp;Each frame&nbsp;is divided into a grid 
			of 8x8 blocks. If&nbsp; n is the number of the current frame, then for each 
			block of this grid RestoreMotionBlocks&nbsp;looks at&nbsp;the&nbsp;luma of 
			this&nbsp;block in neighbour(n-1) and neighbour(n+1).&nbsp;Note that we don't 
			use the frame neighbour(n). There are three comparison methods (the old 
			RemoveDirt has only one). If noise= 0, then simply the SAD of&nbsp;each block 
			in&nbsp; neighbour(n-1) and neighbour(n+1) is computed. If it is &gt;= 
			mthreshold, the block is identified as a motion block of frame n. This is the 
			fasted method and a similar method was used in the old RemoveDirt. Its key 
			disadvantage is that it may easily misled by noise. If noise &gt;=0, then 
			instead of SUM(|y-x|) RestoerMotionBlocks calculates SUM(| |y-x|-noise |). In 
			particular, differences with absolute value &lt;= noise are ignored. If it is 
			&gt;= mthreshold, then this block is identified&nbsp;as a motion block. We call 
			this the noise adjusted SAD. From the way how the noise adjusted SAD is 
			calculated, it is clear, that "mthreshold" should be decreased if&nbsp; "noise" 
			is increased. &nbsp;If noise &gt;= 0 and noisy &gt;= 0, then 
			RestoreMotionblocks counts the number of pixels of a block, for which the 
			absolute difference between neighbour(n-1) and neighbour(n+1) is &gt;= noise. 
			If this number&nbsp;is &gt;= &nbsp;value of "noisy", then the block is 
			identified as a motion block. We call this the NPC (= noisy pixel counting) 
			method. The value of mthreshold is ignored, if NPC is selected. Note that a 
			block has 64 pixels. Thus, if noisy &gt; 64, then there can't be any motion 
			blocks. In my view NPC is clearly the best method. It has likely about half the 
			speed of SAD and about the same speed as NSAD.&nbsp; Noise=-1 and noisy=-1 are 
			the default values. Thus SAD is the default method for the first phase. I ran 
			most of my RemoveDirt tests with noise=8 or 10&nbsp;and noisy= 12.&nbsp;In the 
			sequel the motion blocks found in the first phase are called phase 1 motion 
			blocks.&nbsp; In the second phase, for&nbsp;each block all the motion blocks 
			found in the first phase which have a distance &lt;= dist are counted. If the 
			result&nbsp;is &gt;= (tolerance /100) * (the number of all first phase blocks 
			with distance &lt;= dist) , then this block is&nbsp;called a <EM>motion neighbour</EM>
			&nbsp;block. For instance, if dist = 1 and tolerance= 12 (the default values), 
			then there are 9 blocks with a distance &lt;= 1. Since 1 &lt; (12/100)*9 &lt; 
			2, there must be at least 2 phase 1 motion blocks among the 9 neighbour blocks 
			such that the block is marked as a motion neighbour&nbsp;block. If dmode= 0, 
			then all the motion neighbour blocks become phase 2 motion blocks. Thus if 
			dmode=0 the number of motion blocks is increased quite a bit. If dmode= 2, then 
			quite the opposite happens: a&nbsp;phase 1 motion block only becomes a phase 2 
			motion block, if it is&nbsp;also a motion neighbour block.&nbsp;In particular, 
			there are less&nbsp;phase 2 motion blocks&nbsp;than phase1 motion blocks. For 
			instance, if dist=1, tolerance= 2, dmode= 2, then a single phase 1 motion block 
			is dicarded if there exists no further phase 1 motion block with a distance 
			less than 1.&nbsp;Dmode=1 is just in the middle between dmode=0 and dmode= 2: 
			the motion neighbour blocks&nbsp;become the phase 2 motion blocks. Thus, if 
			dmode=1, the phase 1 motion blocks are only relevant for detecting motion 
			neighbour blocks. After this task is completed the phase 1 information is 
			discarded. If dist=0 or dmode=2 gmthreshold should be lowered to 60 or even 50. 
			The third phase, called the postprocessing phase,&nbsp;starts 
			with&nbsp;restoring&nbsp;the phase 2 motion blocks by copying them from the 
			clip "restore" to the clip "filtered".&nbsp;All phase 2 motion blocks become 
			also phase 3 motion blocks. Then the edges between motion and non-motion blocks 
			are inspected. To this end the SAD of the two adjacent border line segments is 
			calculated twice (these line segments are either horizontal or vertical and are 
			8 pixels long). It is calculated&nbsp;first in the clip "restore" and then in 
			the clip "filtered". In the clip "filtered" the two blocks are from two 
			different sources, one block, the motion block was restored from the clip 
			"restore" and the non-motion block is from the original clip 
			"filtered".&nbsp;Since the frames of the clip "restore" are not changed at all, 
			both blocks are from the same source and should therefore fit together. If the 
			edge SAD in the clip "filtered" &gt; (edge SAD in the clip restore) + 
			pthreshold, then the block is marked as a&nbsp;new (additional) phase 3 motion 
			block and the block is restored by copying it from "restore" to "filtered", 
			because the two blocks in "filtered" don't fit together&nbsp;well enough 
			compared with the two blocks in "restore". In other words, &nbsp;in this phase, 
			it is checked whether&nbsp;a restored block fits to the yet unrestored blocks. 
			If it doesn't, the not yet restored&nbsp;blocks, which do not fit 
			well,&nbsp;are marked as phase 3 motion blocks and are restored as well. This 
			procedure is repeated until there are no more blocks, which&nbsp;can be tested. 
			If the value of the grey variable is false, then the same is done for the luma 
			and the chroma (for the chroma the variable cthreshold is used instead of 
			pthreshold). If grey= true, then&nbsp;postprocessing is only done for the luma.</P>
		<P>Finally, if the percentage of all phase 3 motion blocks with respect to all 
			blocks exceeds the value of gmthreshold, then the "filtered" frame is discarded 
			and replaced by the corresponding frame in "alternative".&nbsp;&nbsp;In this 
			way, we can give special treatments for sharp scene switches and scenes with a 
			moving or zooming camera.</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">Black&amp;White Clips</FONT></H2>
		<P>If grey=true the chroma of the clip "filtered" is not touched by 
			RestoreMotionBlocks. Also for postprocessing only the luma is used. This is 
			slightly faster than grey=false. If you use grey=false for b&amp;w clips, then 
			it not only takes longer but also the quality may degrade, because chroma noise 
			may trigger false postprocessing. Thus "grey=true"&nbsp;is&nbsp;highly 
			recommended for b&amp;w clips.
		</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">Debugging</FONT></H2>
		<P>The boolean variable <EM>debug</EM> and <EM>show</EM> are used for 
			debugging.&nbsp;If show=true, then the blocks, which are marked as motion 
			blocks in the first phase are colored red, those found in the second phase are 
			colored green and finally the motion blocks marked by postprocessing are 
			colored blue. In this way, one can easily check whether the above variables 
			were selected appropriately. if debug=true, then RestoreMotionBlocks 
			sends&nbsp;&nbsp;output of the following kind to the <A href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/debugview.shtml" target="_blank">

		<H2><FONT size="6">SCSelect</FONT></H2>
		<P>SCSelect is a special filter, which distinguishes between scene begins, scene 
			ends and global motion. The output of SCClense is used&nbsp;as 
			an&nbsp;"alternative" clip for RestoreMotionBlocks. It can hardly used for 
			other purposes, because it can only make proper decisions if there are a lot of 
			motion blocks. Only if the percentage of motion blocks is &gt; gmthreshold, 
			then RestoreMotionBlocks chooses a frame from the clip specified with the 
			alternative variable and then there are always a lot of motion blocks, if 
			gmthreshold is not too small (gmthreshold &gt;= 30 should be sufficiently 
			large). SCSelect yields nonsense results if there are only few motion blocks. 
			SCSelect is used as follows:</P>
		<center>SCSelect(clip input, clip scene_begin, clip scene_end, clip global_motion, 
			float dfactor, bool debug, bool planar)</center>
		<p>The first four clip variables are mandatory and have no name. All four clips 
			must have the same color space, width and height. The first clip is the clip, 
			on which SCSelect bases its decision. Usually it should be the same clip, which 
			was specified with the "neighbour" variable in RestoreMotionBlocks. If SCSelect 
			realises a scene begin, it selects&nbsp;its output&nbsp;frame from the clip 
			scene_begin. If SCSelect realises a scene end, it selects&nbsp;its 
			output&nbsp;frame from the clip scene_end. If SCSelect realises a global 
			motion, it selects&nbsp;its output&nbsp;frame from the clip global motion. Thus 
			SCSelect doesn't produce any new frames. It only makes a selection from three 
			different sources. Dfactor is the key variable for scene switch sensitivity. 
			The higher dfactor the less scene begins and scene ends and the more global 
			motion frames are detected. Dfactor=4.0 is the default value. SCSelect works 
			with YV12 and planar YUY2. If planar YUY2 is used, then planar=true must be 
			specified. If debug=true, then SCSelect sends output of the following type to 
			the <A href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/debugview.shtml" target="_blank">

		</TABLE>
		<P>To describe the basic idea&nbsp; behind SCSelect let SAD(n)&nbsp; be the SAD 
			difference between the frames input(n) and input(n+1). Now, if SAD(n) &gt; 
			dfactor * SAD(n-1), then SCSelect recognises a scene end and pulls the frame 
			from the clip scene_end. If SAD(n-1) &gt; dfactor * SAD(n), then SCSelect 
			recognises a scene begin and pulls the frame from the clip scene_begin. If both 
			SAD(n)&nbsp;&lt;= dfactor * SAD(n-1) and SAD(n-1) &lt;= dfactor * SAD(n), then 
			SCSelect recognises a global motion and pulls the frame from the clip 
			global_motion. From this dexcription it is clear that dfactor must be &gt; 1 
			for getting reasonable results. The above algorithm is optimised such that 
			often only one and not two SADs are calculated for one requested frame. 
			However, there are certain shortcomings. If a scene ends with global motion, 
			then SCSelect often can't detect the&nbsp;scene end. If a scene begins with 
			global motion, then SCSelect often can't detect the scene begin. These two 
			effects are usually responsible if lonely scene begins and scene ends are 
			detected by SCSelected, otherwise each scene begin should be preceded by a 
			scene end. By refining the above algorithm we could avoid lonely scene begins 
			and scene ends, but there is one situation, where even such a refinement fails. 
			Namely if the scene ends with global motion and the new scene starts with 
			global motion. Then a sharp scene switch can only be detected reliably with a 
			good motion analysis, which would result in an extreme slow down of the filter.

		<H2>&nbsp;<FONT size="6">RemoveDirt</FONT>&nbsp;</H2>
		<P>RemoveDirt has now become an AVS script function, which involves 
			RestoreMotionBlocks and various filters from&nbsp;my <A href="http://www.RemoveGrain.de.tf">
				RemoveGrain</A>&nbsp;package (version 0.9 or higher is necessary). During 
			the tests I used the following script:</P>
		<TABLE id="Table1" bgColor="#99ffff" border="1">
			<TR>
				<TD><PRE>function RemoveDirt(clip input, bool "_grey", int "repmode") 
{
    _grey=default(_grey, false)
	repmode=default(repmode, 16)
	clmode=17
	clensed=Clense(input, grey=_grey, cache=4)
	sbegin = ForwardClense(input, grey=_grey, cache=-1)
	send = BackwardClense(input, grey=_grey, cache=-1)
	alt=Repair(SCSelect(input, sbegin, send, clensed, debug=true), input, mode=repmode, modeU = _grey ? -1 : repmode )

	corrected=RestoreMotionBlocks(clensed, restore, neighbour=input, alternative=alt, gmthreshold=70, dist=1, dmode=2, debug=false, noise=10, noisy=12, grey=_grey)
	return RemoveGrain(corrected, mode=clmode, modeU = _grey ? -1 : clmode )
}	</PRE>
				</TD>
			</TR>
		</TABLE>
		<P>Let us discuss this script in some detail. Firstly, we apply the brutal temporal 
			clenser from the RemoveGrain package to obtain the clip "clensed". Then we use 
			the filters ForwardClense and BackwardClense from RemoveGrain to construct the 
			clip "alt", which is then used as the "alternative" variable in the subsequent 
			RestoreMotionBlocks. While&nbsp;Clense does a lot of cleaning it certainly 
			creates a lot of artifacts in motion areas. In the script function RemoveDust, 
			the clip "clensed" is repaired entirely by the Repair filter from the 
			RemoveGrain package.&nbsp;In RemoveDirt this repair is only&nbsp;made in motion 
			areas. The static areas are <STRONG>not </STRONG>repaired. Since the clip is 
			used only for restoring motion areas, we can use the much stronger Repair 
			mode&nbsp;16 (in RemoveDust usually modes 2 or 5 are used), which restores thin 
			lines destroyed by clense.&nbsp;Finally, because there may be some left over 
			from temporal cleaning especially when grain is dense, we use the spatial 
			denoiser RemoveGrain(mode=17) to remove these dirt or grain rests.
		</P>
		<H2><FONT size="6">Optimal Usage</FONT></H2>
		<P>1. <STRONG>If possible,&nbsp;crop after RestoreMotionBlocks.</STRONG> Modern 
			codecs divide the frames in the same way as RemoveDirt into a grid of 8x8 pixel 
			blocks to perform the crucial <EM>discret cosine transform</EM> for such 
			blocks. Now if the clip is cropped after RemoveDirt, then the grid of 
			RemoveDirt and the codec are likely to be different resulting in&nbsp;inferior 
			compression.&nbsp;There is one exception, though: cropping afterwards does not 
			hurt, if all four sides are cropped by a multiple of 8. For instance, 
			crop(8,64,0,-72) is ok. On the other hand, one should crop after 
			RemoveGrain/Repair if possible, because this filters cannot process the 
			boundary pixels. Thus the optimal solution is to crop afterwards and then only 
			by multiples of 8, which unfortunately is not always possible.
		</P>
		<P>2. Avisynth 2.6 hint: <STRONG>Crop only with "align=true"</STRONG>. 
            RestoreMotionBlocks uses SSE2 instructions. If you crop without "align= true" before 
			RestoreMotionBlocks, then the data on the frames may not be properly aligned 
			and RemoveDirt will execute substantially slower. As a consequence you should 
            always crop with Avisynth and not&nbsp;with DVD2AVI or DGIndex.</P>
		<P>3. <STRONG>Telecined movies must be inverse telecined before RemoveDirt</STRONG>. 
			If a film is telecined some fields are doubled in order to increase the frame 
			rate from 24fps to 30fps. Hence on such doubled fields the basic property of 
			dirt, described above, is no more valid and no temporal cleaner can ever spot 
			dirt on such doubled fields. On the other hand, after an inverse telecine 
			usually every fourth frame is composed of fields, which originate from two 
			different frames. Visually&nbsp;these two fields fit together well but both are 
			from a different <EM>compression context, </EM>which can&nbsp;mislead 
			RemoveDirt to false motion detection. In extreme cases, one field may be from 
			an I- or P-frame, while the other is from a B-frame. But even if the fields are 
			from from&nbsp;frames of identical type, the different compression 
			context&nbsp;has a&nbsp;substantial effect. Consequently RemoveDirt performes 
			less well on inverse telecined movies than on natively progressive movies. By 
			the same reason also compression of inverse telcined movies is worse than of 
			natively progressive movies.&nbsp;We in Europe should thank god every day that 
			we are not getting telecined. However, here in Germany we have digital tv 
			broadcasters, which like to comb progressive films (about 5% of all progressive 
			movies from ARD and especially ZDF are combed). Fortunately these idiots are 
			not able to double fields, so RemoveDirt should work, but on combed films the 
			dirt is always split over two frames which clearly hurts RemoveDirt. On the 
			other hand, if these combed films are uncombed, then we have the compression 
			context problem for <EM>any </EM>frame<EM> </EM>and not only for any fourth 
			frame. Stepping through the video with the builtin filter&nbsp;<EM>Bob</EM>()<EM>&nbsp;</EM>one 
			can&nbsp;decide with near absolute certainty, whether the video is truely 
			progressive, interlaced, telecined, field blended or progressive with a field 
			shift.
		</P>
		<P>4. <STRONG>Put other filters after RemoveDirt.</STRONG> Except those filters 
			mentioned before, like crop&nbsp;and inverse telecine, all other filters should 
			be put after RemoveDirt in the Avisynth script, because&nbsp;most filters have 
			a negative rather than a positive impact on&nbsp;dirt detection.</P>
